# System Flow

MarketData → Features → StrategySignal → ScoredSignal → Execution

---

# Rules

## run_strategies
- pure function
- no DB
- no external APIs

## calculate_features
- must use only market data
- no external calls

## execution
- must use config
- no hardcoded values

## RiskManagementSettings
- `strategy_risk_multipliers` must include current strategy keys:
  `trend_pullback_continuation`, `volatility_squeeze_breakout`,
  `liquidity_sweep_reversal`.
- Legacy strategy aliases remain supported:
  `trend_following`, `breakout`, `smart_money_setup`.
- Strategy multiplier lookup uses exact normalized strategy key first,
  then legacy alias fallback, then `1.0`.

## Strategy RR eligibility
- `risk_reward_guard` failed checks make the signal non-actionable for real
  and virtual entries.
- Failed RR snapshots expose `metadata.risk_reward_blocked = true` and
  `metadata.risk_reward_block_reason`.
- Failed RR signals expose disabled `auto_entry` metadata so auto-entry cannot
  be armed by pipeline output.
